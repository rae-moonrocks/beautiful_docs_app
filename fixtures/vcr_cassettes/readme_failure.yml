      string: "# Beautiful Docs\n\nI love documentation. If you work with/are writing
        code intended for usage and consumption by more than one person, you should
        love it, too. Documentation and other resources will make or break the success
        of your project. And the more open and collaborative you want development
        to be, the more crucial docs become.\n\nWith that in mind, here's a list of
        docs and other developer resources that myself and others find particularly
        useful, well-written, and otherwise \"beautiful.\" May they serve to inspire
        you when writing and designing yours. Thanks to various contributors, we now
        also have sections dedicated to [Writing about Documentation](#writing-about-docs)
        and [Tools for Generating Docs](#generating-docs).\n\nThis should be updated
        fairly regularly. As usual, **pull requests are encouraged**. \n* If you're
        contributing a link, be sure to include a few words on why you're adding it
        and some sort of self-attribution so that people can know from whom it came.\n*
        All docs are listed in the order they were added. Keep this order when submitting
        your PR. \n\n[Mark](https://twitter.com/pharkmillups)\n\n### And Now For The
        Docs \n\n* [Redis Commands](https://redis.io/commands/) - Most of the Redis
        docs are exceptional, but this section really epitomizes the combination of
        good design and usability. And all the individual command pages give you the
        ability to test things out without leaving the page. Pretty close to perfect.\n*
        [GitHub Developer Docs](https://docs.github.com/en) - I don't always get excited

        [Riak Pipe README](https://github.com/basho/riak_pipe/blob/develop/README.md)
        - The simplicity of READMEs means that you can't obscure shitty content with
        flashy design. This one is written by my Basho colleague [Bryan Fink](https://twitter.com/#!/hobbyist)
        and should be committed to memory as an excellent example of how to write
        READMEs.\n* [Learn You Some Erlang](https://learnyousomeerlang.com/content)
        (contributed by [@lenary](https://twitter.com/lenary)) (It should also be
